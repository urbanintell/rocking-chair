How do you keep from resenting them for the care they need?","

If you are considering accompanying your elderly parent to chemo, you may want to consider their needs and what will make them most comfortable. For some, having a family member present provides valuable support and helps to ease anxiety. Others may prefer to go alone or with a friend. Ultimately, it is up to your parent to decide who they would like by their side during treatment. If they do want you to accompany them, try to be present as much as possible without overburdening yourself. If you need to take time off from work or make other sacrifices, try to communicate openly with your employer and family to set expectations.

It is also important to consider your own wellbeing. Caring for an elderly parent can be emotionally and",2023-02-27

It is understandable that you would want to be there for your mother during her chemo treatments, however it is also understandable that you cannot be there for every single treatment. It is important to communicate with your mother and father about what you are able to do and what you are not able to do. Perhaps you can alternate treatments with your siblings so that someone is always there with your parents. If that is not possible, maybe you can look into hiring in home help for your parents. There are many caregiving services that can help with things like transportation, grocery shopping, and even just providing companionship. Whatever you do, just make sure to communicate with your parents and try to come up with a plan that works for everyone involved.",2023-02-27
